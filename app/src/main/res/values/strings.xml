    <string name="long_text">The standard Lorem Ipsum passage, used since the 1500s
"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum."

Section 1.10.32 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum", written by Cicero in 45 BC
"Sed ut perspiciatis unde omnis iste natus error sit voluptatem accusantium doloremque laudantium, totam rem aperiam, eaque ipsa quae ab illo inventore veritatis et quasi architecto beatae vitae dicta sunt explicabo. Nemo enim ipsam voluptatem quia voluptas sit aspernatur aut odit aut fugit, sed quia consequuntur magni dolores eos qui ratione voluptatem sequi nesciunt. Neque porro quisquam est, qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet, consectetur, adipisci velit, sed quia non numquam eius modi tempora incidunt ut labore et dolore magnam aliquam quaerat voluptatem. Ut enim ad minima veniam, quis nostrum exercitationem ullam corporis suscipit laboriosam, nisi ut aliquid ex ea commodi consequatur? Quis autem vel eum iure reprehenderit qui in ea voluptate velit esse quam nihil molestiae consequatur, vel illum qui dolorem eum fugiat quo voluptas nulla pariatur?"

1914 translation by H. Rackham
"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"

Section 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum", written by Cicero in 45 BC
"At vero eos et accusamus et iusto odio dignissimos ducimus qui blanditiis praesentium voluptatum deleniti atque corrupti quos dolores et quas molestias excepturi sint occaecati cupiditate non provident, similique sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollitia animi, id est laborum et dolorum fuga. Et harum quidem rerum facilis est et expedita distinctio. Nam libero tempore, cum soluta nobis est eligendi optio cumque nihil impedit quo minus id quod maxime placeat facere possimus, omnis voluptas assumenda est, omnis dolor repellendus. Temporibus autem quibusdam et aut officiis debitis aut rerum necessitatibus saepe eveniet ut et voluptates repudiandae sint et molestiae non recusandae. Itaque earum rerum hic tenetur a sapiente delectus, ut aut reiciendis voluptatibus maiores alias consequatur aut perferendis doloribus asperiores repellat."

1914 translation by H. Rackham
"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."

    <string name="long_text_5000_words">Did you know that the Earth is approximately 4.5 billion years old? This ancient planet has witnessed countless events throughout its history. One fascinating fact is that the Earth\'s atmosphere is composed of roughly 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and trace amounts of other gases such as carbon dioxide and argon. These gases play a crucial role in sustaining life on our planet. Speaking of life, did you know that scientists estimate there could be anywhere from 8.7 million to 14 million species living on Earth, with only around 1.2 million species identified and documented? The diversity of life on Earth is truly astounding! Moving beyond our planet, the universe itself holds numerous mind-boggling facts. For instance, the observable universe is estimated to be about 93 billion light-years in diameter. This vast expanse contains billions of galaxies, each with billions of stars. One of these stars, known as the Sun, is the center of our solar system and provides the energy necessary for life on Earth. Interestingly, the Sun is so massive that it accounts for about 99.86% of the total mass of the solar system. Delving into the realm of physics, quantum mechanics presents some truly perplexing facts. According to quantum theory, particles can exist in multiple states simultaneously until they are observed, a phenomenon known as superposition. Furthermore, particles can become entangled, where the state of one particle is dependent on the state of another, regardless of the distance between them. These concepts challenge our understanding of reality and have profound implications for technology, such as quantum computing. On a smaller scale, the human body is a marvel of biological engineering. Did you know that the human brain contains approximately 86 billion neurons, each capable of forming thousands of connections with other neurons? This intricate network of neurons allows us to process information, experience emotions, and form memories. Additionally, the human body is home to trillions of bacteria, collectively known as the microbiome, which play a vital role in digestion, immune function, and overall health. Shifting gears to history, there are countless fascinating events and figures that have shaped the course of human civilization. From the construction of the Great Wall of China to the discovery of penicillin, history is replete with stories of triumph, tragedy, and innovation. Consider the ancient city of Rome, which at its peak, was the largest and most powerful empire in the world. The Romans made significant contributions to architecture, engineering, law, and governance, leaving a lasting legacy that continues to influence modern society. In the realm of technology, the pace of innovation continues to accelerate at an unprecedented rate. Just a few decades ago, the idea of carrying a powerful computer in your pocket would have seemed like science fiction. Today, smartphones are ubiquitous, providing instant access to information, communication, and entertainment. Meanwhile, advancements in artificial intelligence are revolutionizing industries such as healthcare, finance, and transportation, paving the way for a future that was once thought to be beyond the realm of possibility. In the natural world, there are countless wonders to behold. From the majestic beauty of the northern lights to the awe-inspiring power of a volcanic eruption, nature never fails to captivate our imagination. Consider the Great Barrier Reef, the largest coral reef system on Earth, spanning over 2,300 kilometers and teeming with vibrant marine life. Sadly, this natural wonder is under threat from climate change, pollution, and other human activities, highlighting the delicate balance of ecosystems and the importance of conservation efforts. In conclusion, the world is a vast and wondrous place, filled with an endless array of facts, phenomena, and discoveries waiting to be explored. Whether it\'s the mysteries of the universe, the complexities of the human body, or the rich tapestry of history, there is always something new and fascinating to learn. As we continue to uncover the secrets of the cosmos and push the boundaries of knowledge, let us never lose sight of the wonder and beauty that surrounds us each and every day.</string>
